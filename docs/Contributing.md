The projectâ€™s guiding principles:
- **Performance-safe**: event-driven, minimal polling.
- **Modular**: compatibility layers instead of patching external mods directly.
- **Extensible**: all major features toggleable in MCM.
- **Transparent collaboration**: clear repo baseline for GPT-assisted development.

## GPT Collaboration Guidelines
- The **canonical source of truth** for Vesselbound scripts is this GitHub repository.
- When troubleshooting, patching, or extending functionality, GPT should **always refer to the repo version** of a file as the baseline.
- Code pasted in ChatGPT is considered a **scratchpad/draft** unless explicitly marked to replace the repo version.
- When in doubt: **check the repo first**, then apply changes incrementally.
